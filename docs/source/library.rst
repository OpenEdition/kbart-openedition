Integrating to library tools
=================================================

Library tools often come with a knowledge base provided by the sotfware vendor.
For example, ProQuest's services are backed by the `360 CORE KB <https://www.proquest.com/products-services/360-Core.html>`_.
It is possible that such knowledge bases include metadata related to OpenEdition's
catalogue. Yet, you may want to manually setup your ILP to import and update its
data straight from BACON.

In order to do so, the steps to follow depend on the tool you're using. Most of
the time, you should be looking for menus called Electronic Resources Management (ERM) or
Holdings Management. You should be able to add a custom source for your resources,
or as it is sometimes called, set up a locally-managed holdings database.

Extensive documentation on how to perform these operations is provided by
ProQuest for `360 CORE <https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/360_Services/360_Core_Client_Center/0Product_Documentation/Manage_Your_Data/360_Core%3A_Library-Specific_(Library-Managed)_Holdings_Database_--_Overview>`_,
and by EBSCO for `EBSCO Admin <https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/Holdings-Management-Adding-or-Removing-Packages-from-Your-Holdings?language=en_US>`_.
If needed, you should ask your library software provider for support.

   As a complement, `this slideshow from a conference at JABES 2016 <https://fr.slideshare.net/abesweb/jabes-2016-signaler-grce-bacon>`_
   (in French) describes a BACON-based workflow for updating electronic
   collections.

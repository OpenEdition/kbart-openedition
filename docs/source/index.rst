OpenEdition provides electronic resource title lists and coverage data for the documents published on `OpenEdition Books <https://books.openedition.org>`_ and `OpenEdition Journals <https://journals.openedition.org>`_ as `KBART files <https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart>`_. Alternatively, OpenEdition metadata can be harvested using `OpenEdition OAI-PMH repository <https://oai-openedition.readthedocs.io/>`_ or downloaded as `MARC records <https://marc-openedition.readthedocs.io/>`_.

This documentation describes the specific elements related to OpenEdition but does not include a complete description of KBART specifications.
